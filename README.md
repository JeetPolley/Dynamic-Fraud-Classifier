Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Random Forest In R
Credit card fraud poses significant financial risks, requiring robust detection systems to mitigate losses. This project develops a machine learning-based fraud detection model using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset, which contains 284,807 transactions (492 fraudulent). The severe class imbalance (0.17% frauds) challenges traditional classifiers, prompting the use of Random Forest (RF) with ROSE oversampling to enhance minority-class learning.
